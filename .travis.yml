# OS X builds are slower and with annoyingly non-deterministic latency.
# However, we would like to make sure that nothing slips through that won't run
# on OS X, so we configure travis to run OS X tests on `staging`, which is the
# branch that bors uses to test merge candidates and on `master`, to make sure
# any errant manual merges don't break things.
